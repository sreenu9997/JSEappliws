Class 

static 
instance

Method() Block : a block contains name of the method and return data type is called method block...


A class contains properties and methods and blocks


public class Employee{

Employee(){
sysout("default constructor);
}
int number;
static int pno;
{
sysout(block );
}
static {
sysout(static block);
}
public void mOne(){
}
public static void mtwo(){
}
}
===
only constructor level we doesn't have static key word it is applicable for only properties methods and blocks...
 =======
 
 
 static block, static properties, static methods are loaded when class loading time

excution be like

static block
instance block
constructor


static block will execute when ever we call until it is not execute either static method and instance method



what are the elements available in a class


static block
instance block
static method
instance method
static properties
instance properties
constructors

what is the execution order

no order for execution when ever we call it will executes the members

but initialization will happened before constructors call if it is static members (static properties and static methods) 


w a p to demonstrate the order..
