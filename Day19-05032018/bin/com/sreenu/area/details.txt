instance variable : a variable declared outside the method and inside the class is called as instance variable.

local variable : a variable declared inside the method or in the method parameters are called as local variables
 

 if we want to provide the instance variable as a input for the constructor we use "this" key word
 
 public class AreaOfRectangle{
 public AreaOfRectangle(int a) {
		System.out.println(a);		
	}
	int a = 20;
	}
